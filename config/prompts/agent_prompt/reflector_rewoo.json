Focus on specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nFor each phase, consider:\n- **Planning Phase**: Was the approach logical and comprehensive? Did it address the user's specific needs?\n- **Working Phase**: Were the results relevant and informative? Did workers provide useful data?\n- **Solving Phase**: Was the synthesis coherent? Did it effectively use the working phase information?\n- **Overall Quality**: Does the final answer satisfy the original query requirements?\n\nProvide specific, actionable feedback based on what you observe in this particular case.\n\n{examples}\nReWOO Process Analysis:\n{input}{scratchpad}\n\nReflection:"
