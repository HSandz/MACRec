Analyze if the ranking is correct based on the user's rating history and genre preferences.\n\nFor 'rr' (retrieve & rank) tasks, pay special attention to:\n1. GENRE PREFERENCE ACCURACY: Check if the ranking correctly prioritizes genres the user has rated highly (4-5 stars) and de-prioritizes genres the user has rated poorly (1-2 stars)\n2. RATING PATTERN ANALYSIS: Look at the user's historical ratings to identify their strongest preferences\n3. RANKING LOGIC: Ensure the ranking is based on systematic scoring, not just frequency of genres\n4. USER PREFERENCE ALIGNMENT: Verify that highly-ranked items match the user's demonstrated preferences\n\nCOMMON RANKING ERRORS TO IDENTIFY:\n- Prioritizing Comedy/Children's movies for users who prefer Crime/Drama/Adventure\n- Ignoring the user's low ratings for certain genres\n- Not considering rating values, only genre frequency\n- Repeating the same incorrect ranking without improvement\n\nFor failures, provide specific guidance on how to improve the ranking methodology. Possible reasons for failure may be:\n- Wrong genre preference weighting based on ratings\n- Ignoring user's negative ratings for certain genres\n- Using frequency instead of rating-based preference scoring\n- Poor systematic ranking methodology\n- Wrong format for action\n\nIn a few sentences, discover the potential problems in your previous reasoning trial and devise a new, concise, high level plan that aims to mitigate the same failure. For ranking tasks, specify exactly how the agent should calculate genre preferences and score items. Use complete sentences in reasoning. Reflections should be described in JSON format.\n\nPrevious trial:\nInput:\n{input}{scratchpad}\n\nValid reflection example:\n{examples}\n\nReflection:"
